                <p>Harry Kane became the 27th member of the Premier League's "100 Club" and received a special message from
                    the only player who reached the landmark faster than him. He may have needed two attempts from the penalty
                    spot at Anfield to bring up the century, but the Hotspur striker reached the milestone in the
                    second-quickest time in the competition’s history with his stoppage-time penalty in the 2-2 draw with
                    Liverpool on Sunday. It took Kane just 141 matches to reach 100 Premier League goals for Spurs.
                    Only Alan Shearer has reached a century of Premier League goals in fewer matches, taking just 124 appearances
                    to become the club's first member. And Shearer had a special congratulatory message for Kane for reaching
                    the milestone. After joking over what took Kane so long, Shearer praised Kane's "character" for taking
                    the penalty that got him to 100, only a few minutes after seeing his first spot-kick saved.</p>

                <p>The Scout is selecting five Fantasy Premier League players set to make an impact in Gameweek 27. Gerard Deulofeu
                    (WAT) £6.0m The winger's arrival at Vicarage Road has given FPL managers an exciting new midfield target.
                    Deulofeu made an early statement with an impressive home debut. A goal, assist and maximum bonus points
                    in Monday's 4-1 victory over Chelsea ensured a 13-point return.</p>

                <p>West Ham United have completed the signing of Patrice Evra on a free transfer. The 36-year-old defender has
                    agreed to return to the Premier League with the London club until the end of the season. An experienced
                    left-back who made 273 top-flight appearances for Manchester United between 2005 and 2014, Evra won five
                    PL titles as well as the 2007/08 UEFA Champions League with the Red Devils. "I'm really happy to be a
                    Hammer, to be back in the Premier League and I love this game," Evra told West Ham's official website.
                    " I'm just happy to be here, it's really simple.</p>
